As for the maintaning the security features on customers data while developing the services and as well as for protecting the Apis we can use JWT Token validation classes where we can save our Apis from the requests which do not have any authorization tokens.
Generally we use Spring security which handles authentication by reading the authorisation header of incoming Http request and determines if the user has valid authentication. Users will be in having access to a unique access token which are usually in JWT format and when request fails in any of the filter chains then whole HTTP request gets rejected which will helps in preventing data tampering.
